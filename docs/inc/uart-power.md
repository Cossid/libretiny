!!! warning "Important"
	Using a **good, stable 3.3V power supply** is crucial. Most flashing issues are caused by either voltage drops during intensive flash operations, or bad/loose wires. The UART adapter's 3.3V power regulator is usually **not enough**.

	Instead, a regulated bench power supply, or a linear 1117-type regulator is recommended.
