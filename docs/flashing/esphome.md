# Flashing ESPHome

ESPHome can be flashed in few different ways, depending on your needs.

## Built-in flasher

The flasher program built-in LibreTuya is also available for ESPHome.

- use `python -m esphome run yourdevice.yml` to recompile AND upload the firmware
- use `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml` to upload without recompiling

If your device is already running ESPHome, refer to the OTA guide below.

## Other methods

!!! abstract
	All binary files generated by ESPHome will be in `.esphome/build/<yourdevice>/.pioenvs/<yourdevice>/`. The methods described below may require you to get a file from that directory.

	This path will be referred to as **build directory**.

## Over-the-Air (OTA)

This method requires having ESPHome already installed on your device.

- If you've added the Web Server component, navigate to the device's IP address (or `.local` name) in your web browser. Grab `firmware.uf2` from the build directory and drop it on the "OTA Update" field.
- You can also use ESPHome CLI to flash via OTA. Add a `--device` argument to the command, as such: `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml --device yourdevice.local`
