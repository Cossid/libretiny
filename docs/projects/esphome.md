# ESPHome

!!! important
	Read [Getting started](../getting-started/README.md) first - most importantly, the first part about installation.

	**It is very important that you have the latest version of LibreTuya installed** (not `libretuya-esphome` - this is a different thing!) **so that you don't face issues that are already resolved**.

## Download ESPHome

Because ESPHome does not natively support running on non-ESP chips, you need to use a fork of the project.

Assuming you have PlatformIO, git and Python installed:

1. Open a terminal/cmd.exe, create `esphome` directory and `cd` into it.
2. `git clone https://github.com/kuba2k2/libretuya-esphome`
3. `cd` into the newly created `libretuya-esphome` directory.
4. Check if it works by typing `python -m esphome`

!!! tip
	For Linux users (or if `python -m esphome` doesn't work for you):

	- uninstall ESPHome first: `pip uninstall esphome`
	- install the forked version: `pip install -e .`

## Create your device config

1. Go to [Boards & CPU list](../status/supported/), click on your board and remember the **`Board code`**.
2. Create a YAML config file for your device. You can either:
	- use `python -m esphome wizard yourdevice.yml` - type answers to the six questions the wizard asks, OR:
	- write a config file manually:
		```yaml
		esphome:
		  name: yourdevice

		libretuya:
		  board: wr3  # THIS IS YOUR BOARD CODE
		  framework:
		  	version: latest

		logger:
		api:
		  password: ""
		ota:
		  password: ""

		wifi:
		  ssid: "YourWiFiSSID"
		  password: "SecretPa$$w0rd"
		  ap:
		    ssid: "Yourdevice Fallback Hotspot"
		    password: "Dv2hZMGZRUvy"
		```

## Add components

Now, just like with standard ESPHome on ESP32/ESP8266, you need to add components for your device. Visit [ESPHome homepage](https://esphome.io/) to learn about YAML configuration. If you want, you can upload an "empty" config first, and add actual components later.

!!! danger "Important"
	It's highly recommended to **always** include the [`web_server`](https://esphome.io/components/web_server.html) and [`captive_portal`](https://esphome.io/components/captive_portal.html) components - **even in your first "empty" upload**.

	Adding these two components will safeguard you against accidentally soft-bricking the device, by e.g. entering invalid Wi-Fi credentials. The Web Server provides an easy way to flash a new image over-the-air, and the Captive Portal allows to easily open the Web Server on a fallback AP.

## Build & upload

The command `python -m esphome compile yourdevice.yml` will compile ESPHome.

You probably want to refer to the [flashing guide](../flashing/esphome.md) to learn how to upload ESPHome to your device. There's also info on using `tuya-cloudcutter` in that guide.

## Advanced: LT configuration

!!! note
	This part is for advanced users. You'll probably be fine with the default options.

All options from [Options & config](../reference/config.md) can be customized in the `libretuya:` block:

```yaml
libretuya:
  framework:
    version: latest
  lt_config:
    LT_LOG_HEAP: 1
	LT_UART_DEFAULT_PORT: 2
	LT_UART_SILENT_ALL: 0
```
(this is only an example)

Additionally, few options have their dedicated keys:

```yaml
libretuya:
  framework:
    version: latest
  # verbose/trace/debug/info/warn/error/fatal
  loglevel: warn
  # suppress chip's SDK log messages
  # (same as LT_UART_SILENT_ALL above)
  sdk_silent: true
  # disable SWD/JTAG so that all GPIOs can be used
  # set to false if you want to attach a debugger
  gpio_recover: true
```
(these values are defaults)
