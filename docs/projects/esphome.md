# ESPHome

!!! note
	Read [Getting started](../getting-started/README.md) first.

Because ESPHome does not natively support running on non-ESP chips, you need to use a fork of the project.

Assuming you have PlatformIO, git and Python installed:

1. Open a terminal/cmd.exe, create `esphome` directory and `cd` into it.
2. `git clone https://github.com/kuba2k2/libretuya-esphome -b platform/libretuya` (you need the `platform/libretuya` branch)
3. Go to [Boards & CPU list](https://kuba2k2.github.io/libretuya/docs/supported/), click on your board and remember your board code.
4. Create a YAML config file for your device. You can either:
	- use `python -m esphome wizard yourdevice.yml` - type answers to the six questions the wizard asks
	- if your board isn't available in the wizard yet, use the manual YAML method below
	- write a config file manually:
		```yaml
		esphome:
		  name: yourdevice

		libretuya:
		  board: wr3  # THIS IS YOUR BOARD CODE
		  framework:
		  	version: latest

		logger:
		api:
		  password: ""
		ota:
		  password: ""

		wifi:
		  ssid: "YourWiFiSSID"
		  password: "SecretPa$$w0rd"
		  ap:
		    ssid: "Yourdevice Fallback Hotspot"
		    password: "Dv2hZMGZRUvy"
		```
5. Compile and upload ESPHome:
	- `python -m esphome compile yourdevice.yml` - this will only compile the code
	- `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml` - this will upload the previously compiled code
	- `python -m esphome run yourdevice.yml` - this will compile and upload the code

!!! info
	If you want to flash manually:

	The binary file, ready for uploading, will be in `.esphome/build/yourdevice/.pioenvs/yourdevice/`.

	Refer to your board README to find appropriate flashing instructions.
